# FastAPI Deployment Pipeline

This README provides instructions to set up and deploy the FastAPI application using GitHub Actions and AWS resources.

## Prerequisites

1. **Set up GitHub Secrets**: Configure the following GitHub secrets in your repository:
   - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your AWS account ID.
   - `OIDC_ROLE`: The IAM role name created for OpenID Connect (OIDC) access.
   - `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region for deployment (e.g., `ap-south-1`).

2. **AWS Resource Configuration**:
   - Update AWS resource identifiers in the pipeline as needed:
     - `REPO_NAME`: Specify the ECR repository name (default: `my-fastapi-app`).
     - `ROLE_NAME`: Update the IAM role name if needed (default: `tts-role`).
     - CloudFormation `stack-name`: Use a custom stack name if desired.

3. **CloudFormation Setup for OIDC Role**:
   - Before running the pipeline, **create an OIDC role** in your AWS account using the provided CloudFormation template `oidc-role-template.yml` in this repository.
   - Ensure that the created role has sufficient permissions for deploying resources.
   - **Adjustments to make in the OIDC Role Template**:
     - Define your **GitHub organization and repository name** in the trust policy to enable OpenID Connect (OIDC) access.
     - No need to specify AWS account ID or region, as these are dynamically fetched.
     - Example trust relationship JSON in `oidc-role-template.yml`:
       ```yaml
       AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
         Version: "2012-10-17"
         Statement:
           - Effect: "Allow"
             Principal:
               Federated: "arn:aws:iam::${AWS::AccountId}:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
             Action: "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
             Condition:
               StringEquals:
                 "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:<GitHub_Org>/<Repo_Name>:ref:refs/heads/main"
       ```
     - Replace `<GitHub_Org>` with your GitHub organization name and `<Repo_Name>` with the repository name.
     - Make sure the above configuration grants access to GitHub Actions on the `main` branch.

4. **Modify Deployment Parameters**:
   - Replace occurrences of `121263836368` in ARNs with your AWS account ID across all templates and files.
   - Replace `ap-south-1` with your AWS region wherever applicable.
   - Ensure S3 bucket name uniqueness by renaming it if necessary to avoid conflicts.

5. **IAM and Security Configuration**:
   - Review and adjust IAM role permissions and policies as needed for your AWS account structure and security requirements.

## Running the Deployment Pipeline

1. Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the GitHub Actions deployment workflow.
2. The pipeline will:
   - Build and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR.
   - Deploy the CloudFormation stack, creating necessary infrastructure and deploying the application.

## Testing the Application

To test the deployed application, use `curl` to upload a CSV file:

```bash
curl -X POST <your-alb-dns-link>/upload-csv/ -F "file=@sample_hi-IN.csv" -F "source=hi-IN"
```

Replace `<your-alb-dns-link>` with the DNS of your Application Load Balancer.

## Notes

- Run tests to ensure successful deployment in the target environment.

This README now includes the updated trust relationship configuration, allowing for dynamic fetching of account details while specifying only the GitHub organization and repository name.
